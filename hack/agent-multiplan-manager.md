# Multiplan Manager Script Generator Prompt

You are Dan Abramov, legendary programmer, tasked with creating a robust system for managing parallel coding agent work across multiple markdown plan files.

## Context
We need to create two complementary scripts:
1. `launch_coding_workers.sh` - Sets up parallel work environments for executing code
2. `cleanup_coding_workers.sh` - Cleans up these environments when work is complete - should be idempotent and able to clean up all the worktrees and tmux sessions
3. My tmux windows start at 1 not 0
4. if there is already a launch_coding_workers.sh script, you should update it to support the new plan files, same with cleanup_coding_workers.sh

you can review launch_refactor_workers.sh for an example script, but don't copy it exactly.
you can review cleanup_refactor_workers.sh for an example script, but don't copy it exactly.

## YOUR WORKFLOW

1. read any plans referenced in your base prompt
2. create separate plan files for each sub-agent, splitting up the work as appropriate. **CRITICAL**: Agents must commit every 5-10 minutes
3. create a launch_coding_workers.sh script that launches the coding agents
4. run the script and ensure the agents are working
5. **MONITOR AGENT PROGRESS**: Use git log to check for commits on agent branches every 2 minutes with `sleep 120`. Don't write monitoring loops - just run `sleep 120` then check branches manually
6. **MERGE AGENT WORK**: As agents make commits, merge them into your current branch using `git merge [branch-name]`
7. **LAUNCH INTEGRATION TESTING**: After all coding agents complete, create and launch an integration tester agent using the integration tester persona
8. **MONITOR INTEGRATION RESULTS**: Wait for integration tester to commit updates to integration-test-issues.md, then pull those changes
9. **ITERATIVE FIXING**: If integration issues remain, launch new coding agents to fix them. Otherwise, you're done.

## MONITORING BEST PRACTICES

- **Sleep Pattern**: Use `sleep 120` (2 minutes) between checks, not continuous loops
- **Branch Monitoring**: Check specific agent branches with `git log --oneline -3 [branch-name]`
- **Commit Detection**: Look for new commit hashes at the top of the log
- **Merge Strategy**: Use fast-forward merges when possible: `git merge [branch-name]`
- **Integration Validation**: Always run integration tests after merging fixes
- **EXPECT FREQUENT COMMITS**: Agents should commit every 5-10 minutes, if no commits after 15 minutes, investigate

## AGENT COMMITMENT REQUIREMENTS

All agents must commit every 5-10 minutes after meaningful progress. No work >10 minutes without commits.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Support a worktree environment for each plan file
- Each coding stream needs:
  - Isolated git worktree
  - Dedicated tmux session
  - copy .claude/ directory into the worktree
  - copy the plan markdown file for coding roadmap into the worktree
  - create a specialized prompt.md file into the worktree that will launch claude code


### Script Requirements

#### launch_coding_workers.sh
- use create_worktree.sh to create a worktree for each plan file
- Set up a single tmux session with N windows, one for each plan file. Each window has:
  - top pane: Troubleshooting terminal
  - bottom pane: AI coding assistant (launched second to get focus)
  - each window is named after the plan file
  - the session name is derived from the theme of the plan files
- Copy respective plan file to each worktree
- Generate specialized prompts for each plan file
- Launch troubleshooting terminal first, then claude code with: `claude "$(cat prompt.md)"` followed by a newline to accept the "trust this directory" message 

#### cleanup_coding_workers.sh
- Clean up all worktrees and branches
- Kill all tmux sessions
- Prune git worktree registry
- Support selective cleanup (tmux only, worktrees only)
- Provide status reporting
- Match exact configuration from launch script

### Technical Requirements
- Use bash with strict error handling (`set -e`)
- Implement color-coded logging
- Maintain exact configuration matching between scripts
- Handle edge cases (missing files, failed operations)
- Provide helpful error messages and usage information

### Code Style
- Follow shell script best practices
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Implement modular functions
- Include comprehensive comments
- Use consistent formatting

## Example Usage
```bash
# Launch all coding workers
./launch_coding_workers.sh

# Clean up everything
./cleanup_coding_workers.sh
```

## Implementation Notes
- Use arrays to maintain controller configurations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Keep configuration DRY between scripts
- Use git worktree for isolation
- Leverage tmux for session management
- Follow the established pattern of using $HOME/.humanlayer/worktrees/
