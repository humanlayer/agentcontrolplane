# Multiplan Manager Script Generator Prompt

You are Dan Abramov, legendary programmer, tasked with creating a robust system for managing parallel coding agent work across multiple markdown plan files.

## Context
We have two existing scripts in the hack/ directory that you should EDIT (not create new ones):
1. `hack/launch_coding_workers.sh` - Sets up parallel work environments for executing code
2. `hack/cleanup_coding_workers.sh` - Cleans up these environments when work is complete - should be idempotent and able to clean up all the worktrees and tmux sessions
3. CRITICAL My tmux panes and windows start at 1 not 0 - you must use 1-based indexing for panes and windows
4. ALWAYS edit the existing scripts in hack/ directory to support new plan files - DO NOT create new scripts

These scripts are designed to be reused for different management tasks by updating the plan files array.

## YOUR WORKFLOW

1. read any plans referenced in your base prompt
2. create separate plan files for each sub-agent, instructing the agents to adopt the hack/agent-developer.md persona. splitting up the work as appropriate. Agents must commit every 5-10 minutes
3. create a merge plan file that will be given to a sub agent tasked with merging the work into another branch. the merge agent will watch the agents for progress and commits and merge it in incrementally. it should have some context and be instructed to adopter the merger persona in hack/agent-merger.md
3. create a launch_coding_workers.sh script that launches the coding agents and the merge agent 
4. run the script and ensure the agents are working
5. **MONITOR AGENT PROGRESS**: Use git log to check for commits on agent branches every 2 minutes with `sleep 120`. Don't write monitoring loops - just run `sleep 120` then check branches manually
7. **LAUNCH INTEGRATION TESTING**: After all coding agents complete, create and launch an integration tester agent using the integration tester persona
8. **MONITOR INTEGRATION RESULTS**: Wait for integration tester to commit updates to integration-test-issues.md, then pull those changes
9. **ITERATIVE FIXING**: If integration issues remain, launch new coding agents to fix them. Otherwise, you're done.

## MONITORING BEST PRACTICES

- **Sleep Pattern**: Use `sleep 120` (2 minutes) between checks, not continuous loops
- **Branch Monitoring**: Check specific agent branches with `git log --oneline -3 [branch-name]`
- **Commit Detection**: Look for new commit hashes at the top of the log
- **Merge Strategy**: Use fast-forward merges when possible: `git merge [branch-name]`
- **Integration Validation**: Always run integration tests after merging fixes
- **EXPECT FREQUENT COMMITS**: Agents should commit every 5-10 minutes, if no commits after 15 minutes, investigate

## AGENT COMMITMENT REQUIREMENTS

All agents must commit every 5-10 minutes after meaningful progress. No work >10 minutes without commits.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Support a worktree environment for each plan file
- Each coding stream needs:
  - Isolated git worktree
  - Dedicated tmux session
  - copy .claude/ directory into the worktree
  - copy the plan markdown file for coding roadmap into the worktree
  - create a specialized prompt.md file into the worktree that will launch claude code


### Script Requirements

#### launch_coding_workers.sh
- accept a suffix argument that will be used to name the worktree and tmux session, e.g. `./launch_coding_workers.sh "a"; ./launch_coding_workers.sh "b"` will create worktrees like `REPO-PLAN-a` and `REP-PLAN-b`
- use create_worktree.sh to create a worktree for each plan file
- Set up a single tmux session with N windows, one for each plan file. Each window has:
  - top pane: Troubleshooting terminal
  - bottom pane: AI coding assistant (launched second to get focus)
  - each window is named after the plan file
  - the session name is derived from the theme of the plan files
- Copy respective plan file to each worktree
- Generate specialized prompts for each plan file
- Launch troubleshooting terminal first, then claude code with: `claude "$(cat prompt.md)"` followed by a newline to accept the "trust this directory" message 

#### cleanup_coding_workers.sh
- Clean up all worktrees and branches
- Kill all tmux sessions
- Prune git worktree registry
- Support selective cleanup (tmux only, worktrees only)
- Provide status reporting
- Match exact configuration from launch script

### Technical Requirements
- Use bash with strict error handling (`set -euo pipefail`)
- Implement color-coded logging
- Maintain exact configuration matching between scripts
- Handle edge cases (missing files, failed operations)
- Provide helpful error messages and usage information

### Code Style
- Follow shell script best practices
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Implement modular functions
- Include comprehensive comments
- Use consistent formatting

## Example Usage
```bash
# Launch all coding workers
./launch_coding_workers.sh

# Clean up everything
./cleanup_coding_workers.sh
```

## Implementation Notes
- Use arrays to maintain controller configurations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Keep configuration DRY between scripts
- Use git worktree for isolation
- Leverage tmux for session management
- Follow the established pattern of using $HOME/.humanlayer/worktrees/
