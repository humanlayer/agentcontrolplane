# Integration Isolation Test Results

## Test Summary
Successfully tested worker isolation using the updated launch script with integration tester agents.

## Test Setup
- **Script**: `hack/launch_coding_workers.sh` 
- **Persona**: `hack/agent-integration-tester.md`
- **Workers**: 2 separate integration testing workers

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed KUBECONFIG Path Issue
**Problem**: Script was using relative path `./.kube/config` which wouldn't work in subdirectories.
**Solution**: Changed to absolute path using `"$worktree_dir/.kube/config"`

### 2. Enhanced Claude Trust Prompt Handling  
**Problem**: Claude interactive trust prompts sometimes weren't being accepted.
**Solution**: Added multiple C-m confirmations with proper timing:
```bash
sleep 2
tmux send-keys -t "$target_window" C-m
sleep 1  
tmux send-keys -t "$target_window" C-m
sleep 1
tmux send-keys -t "$target_window" S-Tab  # Auto-accept edits mode
```

### 3. Updated Agent Personas
**Integration Tester**: Removed redundant deployment steps since ACP controller is now deployed during setup.
**Developer**: Added clear documentation about the isolated environment setup.

## Test Results

### Isolation Verification ✅
- **KIND Clusters**: 3 total (`acp-acp-merge-claude`, `acp-isolation-test-1`, `acp-isolation-test-2`)
- **Worktrees**: 4 total (main, merge-claude, isolation-test-1, isolation-test-2)
- **Tmux Windows**: Separate windows for each worker
- **KUBECONFIG**: Each worker has isolated config pointing to its own cluster

### Cluster Context Verification ✅
- Worker 1: `kind-acp-isolation-test-1`
- Worker 2: `kind-acp-isolation-test-2`
- Each worker sees only its own cluster and resources

### Port Isolation ✅
- Worker 1: KIND_APISERVER_PORT=11001, ACP_SERVER_PORT=11101
- Worker 2: KIND_APISERVER_PORT=11002, ACP_SERVER_PORT=11102

## Conclusion
The worker isolation system is working perfectly. Each worker has:
- Its own isolated KIND cluster
- Separate KUBECONFIG pointing to the correct cluster
- Independent port allocations
- No cross-contamination between environments

The updated script handles Claude's interactive prompts reliably and automatically enables auto-accept edits mode.
