# Progress

## Completed

1. LLM Custom Resource
   - API types with validation
   - Controller with OpenAI API key validation
   - Unit tests with good coverage
   - Sample manifests

2. Tool Custom Resource
   - API types with function and delegation support
   - Basic controller with ready state
   - Unit tests with good coverage
   - Sample manifests for function and delegation tools

3. Agent Custom Resource
   - API types with LLM and Tool references
   - Controller with dependency validation
   - Unit tests verifying dependency validation
   - Sample manifests

4. Task and TaskRun Custom Resources
   - API types defined
   - Basic controllers implemented
   - Sample manifests created
   - Dependency validation for Task-Agent relationships

## Next Steps

1. Implement TaskRun Controller
   - Watch for new TaskRuns
   - Send messages to the LLM
   - Track the context window in the taskrun status
   - Track execution status and output
   - Handle errors and retries

2. Implement TaskRunToolCall
   - Update the TaskRun controller to generate TaskRunToolCall resources when the LLM response has tool calls
   - Update the TaskRunToolCall controller to execute the tool call and update the TaskRun with the tool call response

3. Integration Testing
   - End-to-end test with LLM, Tool, Agent, Task, and TaskRun
   - Test error cases and recovery
   - Test concurrent task execution

4. Future Enhancements
   - Add support for more LLM providers
   - Implement more built-in tools
   - Add task scheduling and queuing
   - Support for task dependencies
   - Add metrics and monitoring
